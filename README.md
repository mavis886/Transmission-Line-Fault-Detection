# Transmission-Line-Fault-Detection
A Transmission Line Fault Detection System designed to monitor voltage, current, and detect faults in a small-scale power transmission model. This project identifies abnormal conditions such as short circuits, line interruptions, overloads, or ground faults, and displays real-time status on an LCD / Mobile App / Web Dashboard using ESP32 / Arduino.
